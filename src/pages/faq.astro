					<FaqItem
						id="missing-song-info"
						question="The media flyout is missing information about the song I'm listening to">
						<p>
							This is a limitation of the media player you're
							using, not FluentFlyout. We use the media API
							provided by Windows (SMTC). If the developers of
							your media player haven't implemented this system,
							FluentFlyout cannot see the data.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Note:</strong> the native Windows 10/11 media
							flyout also wouldn't be able to see the song info.
						</p>
						<p class="italic">
							(In basic terms: imagine a class of students
							submitting homework to a teacher. FluentFlyout is
							the teacher, and the media players are the students.
							If a student (the media player) doesn't hand in
							their homework, the teacher (FluentFlyout) cannot
							read it, even if the work was actually done.)
						</p>
					</FaqItem>

					<FaqItem
						id="bluetooth-trackpad"
						question="Trackpad & Bluetooth volume control isn't recognized by FluentFlyout">
						<p>
							This is a Windows limitation. Currently, there is no
							Windows API that allows third-party apps to detect
							when a Bluetooth device or a trackpad has changed
							the volume.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Note:</strong> the native Windows 10/11 volume
							flyout also wouldn't be able to detect volume changes
							from Bluetooth.
						</p>
					</FaqItem>

					<FaqItem
						id="taskbar-widget-issues"
						question="The Taskbar Widget doesn't show up / doesn't work / crashes">
						<p>
							Make sure you don't have any other programs
							interfering or changing how the Windows 11 Taskbar
							functions: the Taskbar Widget injects itself
							directly into the <b>native Windows Taskbar</b>, so
							any tool that heavily modifies the taskbar code
							could break this injection.
						</p>
						<p>
							There have been reports of it working with
							customized WindHawk taskbars, as these are often
							just visual modifications (not deep code changes).
						</p>
					</FaqItem>

					<FaqItem
						id="media-flyout-not-appearing"
						question="The Media Flyout doesn't appear when I change the volume">
						<p>
							Ensure FluentFlyout is running (check your system
							tray) and that there's currently media playing. The
							media flyout only appears when media is detected.

					</FaqItem>

					<FaqItem
						id="media-player-compatibility"
						question="Does FluentFlyout work with all media players?">
						<p>

							supports Windows' System Media Transport Controls
							(SMTC). This includes most popular players like:
						</p>
						<p>

							/>

					<FaqItem
						id="store-vs-github"
						question="What's the difference between the Microsoft Store and GitHub versions?">
						<p>
							Both versions share the same core functionality. The
							only differences are:
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>Microsoft Store:</strong> Provides automatic updates,
							easier installation, optional one-time purchase to unlock
							a few extra features.
						</p>
						<p>
							<strong>GitHub:</strong> Completely free and open-source,
							manual updates required, and all features are unlocked.
						</p>

					<FaqItem
						id="system-resources"
						question="Does FluentFlyout use a lot of system resources (RAM / processing power)?">
						<p>
							FluentFlyout is designed to be lightweight and runs
							quietly in the background. You should expect around
							<b>50MB - 200MB</b> of RAM usage in normal scenarios.
							There should be negligible or <b>basically 0%</b> CPU
							usage while running in the background on modern computers.
							We always try our best to optimize as much as possible!
